## Abstract

Estimating disease prevalence at a sub-city neighborhood scale enables early, targeted interventions that can save lives and reduce public health burdens. 
However, accurately identifying neighborhood-level disease prevalence is challenging due to the cost-prohibitive nature of localized data collection, difficulties in accessing confidential medical records, and the complexity of interactions between multiple potential determinants.

To address these challenges and capture a multidimensional perspective on the determinants of chronic respiratory diseases, this study investigates the environmental, socio-demographic, and behavioral predictors of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) at the census tract level in Pennsylvania using machine learning models.
By localizing the analysis to this geographic granularity, we aim to gain a nuanced understanding of spatial disparities in respiratory health.
Drawing on data from tobacco retailer density, census records, health risk behavior surveys, seasonally classified land cover datasets, and satellite-derived vegetation indices, the study identifies the most significant predictors of COPD prevalence. It also evaluates the performance of various analytical techniques, including multilayer perceptron, support vector regression, and random forest regression.

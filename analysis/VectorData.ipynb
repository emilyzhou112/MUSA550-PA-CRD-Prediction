    "To get all the vector data required in this study, we used the following packages. The `cenpy` package provides a streamlined interface for accessing data from the U.S. Census Bureau's APIs, such as the American Community Survey (ACS) and Decennial Census. It simplifies querying demographic, socioeconomic, and housing data directly from census databases. The `pygris` package focuses on working with the U.S. Census Bureau's geographic data, particularly boundary files like TIGER/Line shapefiles. We would also need `geopandas` and `pandas` for working with spatial and tabular data, respectively, to load and further process downloaded data.\n",

All file paths have been removed.</span>\n",

    "Including these census variables is critical for analyzing COPD rates because the condition is influenced by demographic, social, and environmental factors. For example, COPD prevalence varies across racial and ethnic groups due to disparities in healthcare access, environmental exposures, and socioeconomic conditions, making it essential to include race and ethnicity data. Age distribution data is also vital since COPD predominantly affects older adults; understanding the size and characteristics of elderly populations helps identify at-risk groups. Additionally, disability prevalence provides insight into potential comorbidities and healthcare needs among populations with COPD, as individuals with disabilities often face heightened vulnerability to chronic conditions. By integrating these data, the project can explore correlations between COPD rates and demographic characteristics, identify vulnerable subpopulations, and inform targeted public health strategies. This comprehensive approach supports evidence-based decision-making to address health disparities and improve outcomes."

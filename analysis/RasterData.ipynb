    "To get remote sensing data, we used the following packages. The **`ee`** package (Earth Engine Python API) facilitates interaction with Google Earth Engine for large-scale geospatial processing. **`geemap`** supports visualization and analysis of Earth Engine data in Python. **`os`** is used for interacting with the file system, and **`requests`** handles HTTP requests to retrieve data from web sources. The **`datetime`** module manages date and time operations, while **`geopandas`** and **`pandas`** are essential for working with spatial and tabular data, respectively, to load and further process downloaded data. \n",

    "<span style=\"color:red\">Note: Since the raster data used in this project are relatively large in size, all operations were conducted on Google Colab, which provides a more seamless environment for interacting with Google Earth Engine and is better at handling the processing of large datasets. The code here are just for demonstration purposes. All file paths have been removed.</span>\n",

To begin, users must authenticate using `ee.Authenticate()` and initialize the connection to their GEE project with `ee.Initialize(project=\"your_project_name\")`. Ensure you have a valid Google Earth Engine account and have created a project within your GEE console. These steps enable the seamless integration of Earth Engine operations within the Python environment.\n",

    "We also acquired [USGS National Land Cover Data](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/datasets/catalog/USGS_NLCD_RELEASES_2021_REL_NLCD#bands) for our study area. These images were also obtained via the Google Earth Engine API and are coded in the Earth Engine Data Catalog. We use the 2021 data because that is the latest release avaialbe on Earth Engine and we assume that the landcover of 2021 would match with that of 2022. Afterloading the data,  filter is applied to extract the land cover data for the year 2021. The select method isolates the landcover band, which contains the land cover classification. Then, the data is clipped to the specified area of interest (aoi), creating a subset focused on Pennsylvania. "

    "This landcover dataset is publicly available and consists of 8 main land cover classes and 20 sub-classes of land cover. These classes include Water (open water and perennial ice/snow), Developed (high, medium, low and open space), Barren (rock/sand/clay), Forest (deciduous, evergreen and mixed), Shrubland (dwarf shrub and shrub), Herbaceous (grassland, sedge, lichens and moss), Planted/ Cultivated (pasture/hay and cultivated crops) and Wetlands (woody and emergent herbaceous).

    "In this study, various land cover types are grouped into broader categories based on their respective NLCD codes for simplicty of analysis. For example, **high-density areas** are defined as land cover types 23 and 24, which typically represent urban environments. Similarly, **low-density areas** (codes 21 and 22) correspond to open spaces like barren land and low-density residential areas. **Forested areas** are grouped under codes 41, 42, and 43, while **grasses** are categorized with codes 52, 71, 81, and 82. **Wetlands and open water** are also identified using their specific codes (90, 95, and 11). This categorization simplifies the analysis by grouping similar land cover types together based on their characteristics, enabling focused analysis of specific land use patterns."

    "As briefly mentioned in the workflow, given that these proportions can be similar across multiple census tracts despite the underlying distribution of land cover being different (e.g., two census tracts can have the same percentage of highly developed land, but that land can be geographically concentrated in one tract and distributed in the other), we introduced additional features to represent the distribution of land cover features. For each census tract we calculate features representing i) the proportion of high developed land pixels neighboring another high developed land pixel and ii) the proportion of forest pixels neighboring another forest pixel. These features were intended to capture the notion that developed land corresponds to higher level of pollution while forests and trees can be a source of pollen, both of which have adverse impact on patients suffering from asthma and COPD.\n",

    "The code below achieves this goal. It first creates a kernel for identifying neighboring pixels, then calculates the total number of land cover pixels within each region. It also computes the number of neighboring land cover pixels using a convolution operation to identify adjacent pixels. These calculations are performed using the `reduceRegions` method to aggregate the data for each region of interest (e.g., census tracts) from the input land cover mask. The results are then merged, associating the total land cover and neighboring land cover values with their corresponding region identifiers (GEOID). Finally, the function exports the aggregated data as a CSV file to Google Drive. "
